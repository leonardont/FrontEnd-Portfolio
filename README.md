# Leonardo's HTML and CSS Portfolio
<h2>My HTML and CSS portfolio.<h2>
<br>
<br>
This project and the ones referenced inside it were done as part of the freeCodeCamp course of Responsive Web Design, in which I learned and studied a lot to cover the HTML and CSS languages.
<br>
<br>
This portfolio does not contain JavaScript or other libraries, it is exclusively dedicated to HTML and CSS.<br>
