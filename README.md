# Leonardo's HTML and CSS Portfolio
My personal HTML and CSS portfolio, from the freeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" course. <br>
<br>
This project and the ones referenced inside it were done as part of the freeCodeCamp course of Responsive Web Design, in which I learned and studied a lot to cover the HTML and CSS languages. <br>
<br>
NOTE: This portfolio does not contain JavaScript or other languages, since it is exclusively dedicated to HTML and CSS. <br>
