# Leonardo's Front-End Portfolio
My personal HTML and CSS portfolio. <br> 
This project and the ones referenced inside it were done as part of the freeCodeCamp course of Responsive Web Design, in which I learned and studied a lot to cover the HTML and CSS languages. <br>
This project will not be receiving constant updates, as in my vision, it is polished and clean. But of course, I may do some improvements in the future related to the general construction of the site, moving some items up and down in the CSS. <br>
This portfolio does not contain any JavaScript or other libraries, it is exclusively dedicated to HTML and CSS.
